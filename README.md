# COSC-2436
Spring 2023 COSC-2436: Data Structures and Algorithms for Austin Community College.

## Projects
Each sub-directory is a different data structure or project/assignment. There are various restrictions imposed by the professor for each of the assignments, so these data structures/algorithms are not optimized for time or space complexity. Each project directory contains the assignment instructions to indicate what the assignment was and to show why certain decisions were made. This was my first exposure to development in C++.
